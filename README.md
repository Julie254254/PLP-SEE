# 🧮 Simple Calculator

A simple calculator application built to perform basic arithmetic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division**.

## 🚀 Features

* Add two numbers
* Subtract one number from another
* Multiply two numbers
* Divide one number by another (with error handling for division by zero)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Programming Language: `Python` (or you can replace this with JavaScript, C++, etc.)
* No external libraries required

## 📦 How to Run

### If using Python:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-calculator.git
   cd simple-calculator
   ```

2. Run the calculator:

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

### If using a GUI version:

Just double-click `calculator.py` if you're using a desktop GUI version built with something like Tkinter.

## 💡 Example Usage

```python
# Example in Python
add(2, 3)         # Output: 5
subtract(5, 1)    # Output: 4
multiply(4, 6)    # Output: 24
divide(10, 2)     # Output: 5
```

## ⚠️ Notes

* Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
* Division by zero is handled gracefully with an error message.
